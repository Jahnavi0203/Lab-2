        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>In this HTML document, I have structured my resume content within a clearly defined <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag, making it semantically appropriate for representing self-contained compositions. The use of <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tags for each section heading (Objective, Skills, Certifications, Education, Experience, Projects) ensures proper document structure and readability. Each section is further organized with <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags for paragraphs and <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> tags for lists, which provide a clean and accessible format. The addendum itself is placed in a separate <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag with a heading for clarity, detailing my reasoning for the structural choices made in this HTML document.</p>
